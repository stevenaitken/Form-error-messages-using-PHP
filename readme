THe PHP form posts back to itself which you can see within the for action on register.php - form action="<?php echo htmlspecialchars($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']);?>".
Register.php loads registerCheck.php from the includes folder. This file passed variable values back to register.php.

If you look under each form element you will see <span class="error"> * <?php echo $nameErr;?></span> or similar. This is how a message is displayed if form errors occur.

If you look at registerCheck.php you can see where these errors are generated.


Since the page is posting back to itself, we check if $_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] === "POST") has occurred. Only then will the  PHP code be carried out. Nothing will happen unless the submit button has been posted.

The error messages can be presented using HTML and CSS.
